            <p>Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to create
                client-side dynamic pages.

                JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

                JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator
                (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.</p>
            <p>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript
                Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based
                on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. And in cases where some proposals for new
                ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN
                articles may use some of those new features.

                Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
                trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two
                programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.</p>

                JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites
                for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
                interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for
                adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by
                all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact
                directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms
                of interactivity and simplicity.
            <p>
                Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and
                provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers,
                databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

                A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in
                JavaScript : local variable and global variable.

                There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).

                1. Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
                2. After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
                3. JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
                <code>var x = 10;  
                var _value="sonoo"; </code>
                <code>var  123=30;  
                    var *aa=320;  </code>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="Scope">Scope</header>
            <p>
                The current context of execution. The context in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be
                referenced. If a variable or other expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for
                use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but
                not vice versa.

                A function serves as a closure in JavaScript, and thus creates a scope, so that (for example) a variable
                defined exclusively within the function cannot be accessed from outside the function or within other
                functions. For instance, the following is invalid:\
                <code>
                    function exampleFunction() {
                        var x = "declared inside function";  // x can only be used in exampleFunction
                        console.log("Inside function");
                        console.log(x);
                    }
                    
                    console.log(x);  // Causes error
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the following code is valid due to the variable being declared outside the function, making it
                global:
            </p>
            <code>
                var x = "declared outside function";

                   exampleFunction();

                  function exampleFunction() {
                   console.log("Inside function");
                   console.log(x);
               }

               console.log("Outside function");
               console.log(x);
            </code>

                avaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call JavaScript function many times to reuse
                the code.

                Advantage of JavaScript function
                There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.

                1.Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding.
                2.Less coding: It makes our program compact. We don’t need to write many lines of code each time to
                  perform a common task.
            </p>
            <h4>Function Syntax</h4>
            <code>
                function functionName([arg1, arg2, ...argN]){  
                    //code to be executed  
                   }  
            </code>   
            <h3>JavaScript Function Example</h3>  
            <p>
                Let’s see the simple example of function in JavaScript that does not has arguments.
            </p> 
            <code>
                 
                    function msg(){  
                    alert("hello! this is message");  
                    }  
                    
                
            </code>
